# Spellbook
---
Spellbook utilizes the DND5e API (http://www.dnd5eapi.co/) to aggregate a list of spells from Dungeons And Dragons 5th Edition, and lets you add them to your own custom spellbook.

## Technologies Used
---
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Express, EJS, EJS Layouts
- Axios
- PostgreSQL, Sequelize
- DND5e API

## MVP
---
[✓] Make login page for users to have individual "spellbooks"

[✓] Allow users to browse list of spells and add them to a "spellbook"

[✓] Instead of a list of spells in the spellbooks, use Bootstrap to create card templates

## Stretch Goals
---
[✓] Use Bootstrap Modals

[✓] Add list of classes who can use the spells

[✓] Have a list of different spellbooks that the user created.

[] Allow users to "homebrew" their own spells by being able to modify their saved spell's name/description/material costs/etc.
